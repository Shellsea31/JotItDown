## Description
This week I was tasked to create a Note Taking application. Users should be able to create, read, and delete notes. The assignment introduced me to Express.js which I used to write the back end to save, retrieve, and delete notes. I also used the npm nanoid to create new unique ids for each note. 

First I made sure to install and become familiar with all my frameworks. 
Then I created routes to: 

* **SAVE** notes in JSON format 
* **ADD** new notes to JSON data file
* **DELETE** existing notes from JSON data file
* serve html files
